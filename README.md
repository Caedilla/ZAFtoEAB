# Move the Sanity Orb Button

# About
Mostly for Dominos users - Bartender already can move this button I believe.

Moves the Zone Ability Button to wherever the Extra Action Button is.

The aim is that you can then keep the Sanity Restoration Orb button in the same place as an Extra Action Button as this button is not normally movable. Useful if you have other UI elements in the default area for this button - a common area that people put their class weak auras.

The Zone Ability Button is also used for bodyguard abilities from Legion & garrison abilities from WoD.
